# Soil-Erosion-Prediction-Analysis
This notebook focuses on predicting soil erosion categories using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, and multiple classification models. It also includes model interpretation with SHAP analysis and a comparison of model performances.\
ðŸ”‘ Step-by-Step Breakdown

Import Libraries

Uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data handling and visualization.

Uses scikit-learn for preprocessing, PCA, clustering, and classification.

Uses imblearn.SMOTE for handling imbalanced datasets.

Uses shap for model explainability.

Data Preparation

Loads soil erosion dataset.

Features: multiple soil/environmental indicators.

Target: Erosion Category (classification problem).

Preprocessing includes: scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler), feature engineering (polynomial features), and handling imbalance with SMOTE.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation heatmaps for features.

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality.

Auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation plots for temporal/related features.

Baseline Models

Trains models without preprocessing to establish a baseline accuracy.

Uses confusion matrix visualization for performance assessment.

Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier (baseline & tuned)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluated with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Deep Learning Models

ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

Uses TensorFlow/Keras for implementation.

Trained and evaluated against classical ML models.

Model Interpretability (Explainable AI)

SHAP analysis applied to SVM.

Identifies which features contribute most to erosion prediction.

Model Comparison

Compares accuracy across Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, ANN, CNN, and GRU.

Results plotted for easy interpretation.

Shows performance improvement after preprocessing and feature engineering.
